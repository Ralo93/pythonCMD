## General info
This is a repository of my python functions which I used on the command line for fast EDA and scrubbing. <br>
I am currently working on a python script pipeline which automatically transforms csv-files until the data is clean enough to further process it with machine learning algorithms.

## Sources
Very good book about switching to the command line for data science tasks: <br>
[Data Science from the Command Line ](https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/2e/chapter-1-introduction.html)

## Technologies 
Linux, CommandLine, Docker, Python3, Pandas, Numpy
